          Udvash was born out of a passion. A passion for making a difference.
          Creating a movement of OnnoRokom Manush (different humans) and
          bringing about a change. When Udvash was founded in the latter part of
          2000, its founders had no idea that it would take on a life of its
          own. After about 18 years, it has albeit taken a life of its own and
          turned into an educational institution like no other, pretty much
          uncomfortably without a definition for itself. A category of its own.
        </p>
        <p className="text-2xl font-semibold my-4">
          The beginning was humble. “We started Udvash with a mere 6,000 taka
          investment. We rented a small room at 800 taka rent per month. That’s
          how our journey began. It was quite difficult in the early days since
          we didn’t have adequate resources at our disposal. But we were
          passionate about teaching that helped us survive trials and
          tribulations of those difficult days.” That’s Mahmudul Hasan Sohag,
          Co-founder of Udvash and Co-founder and Chairman of OnnoRokom Group.
          It took Udvash eight years to reach break-even. In those days, Udvash
          founders and team worked hard day and night and in most months did not
          get paid in full. What kept Udvash alive was love. Love for teaching.
        </p>
        <p className="text-2xl font-semibold my-5">
          Love for students. And a strong sense of purpose. Throughout its
          journey, Udvash has been a purpose-driven organization. It has put the
          benefits of its students ahead of its own business or any other
          interest for that matter. Today, Udvash has 42 branches. It teaches
          thousands of students every year. Creates opportunities for hundreds
          more in the form of part-time and full-time employment. Udvash has
          created a new paradigm in the shadow education sector in Bangladesh. A
          paradigm that proposes a new and better approach to learning and
          teaching. That promotes understanding over rote memorization.
          Collaboration over mere competition. That promotes values like
          humility and honesty and helpfulness. A paradigm that says the purpose
          of education is much larger than achieving good grades. Education is
          about teaching how to live a good life and become OnnoRokom (different
          and better) Manus (human being).
